			<h3>Scratch Final Project</h3>
			<img src="Images/finalProject.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>My project will be a game made in Scratch where the player 
			plays a ball trying to get through a maze without touching the 
			walls. The player must also clear each stage as fast as possible 
			and with as least accidents as possible. This is an extension of 
			my original Scratch Project and will be more complicated as a 
			result. I added another stage which is more challenging and complicated 
			than the others with more moving walls where timing is key. I added a 
			scoreboard (using a list) to keep track of the user's and other user's scores which are 
			paired with the user's name. I also added a list to keep track of the items 
			the player picks-up throughout the game. At the end I used a method to count 
			up all the items the player got and then subtract the needed amount from the 
			number of trys and time variables. I also used a method which I gave a integer value 
			for combined score and a string value for the user's name which the method added to the two 
			scoreboard lists which display on the final screen.</p>
			
			<p>The screenshot seen above is of the last and most difficult level is the 
			game. There are three, fast-moving walls and two small squares. If the player obtains the 
			glass of water, their time score (in the top left corner) will decrease by 40 seconds. If they 
			collect the heart, their try count will decrease by two trys.</p>
