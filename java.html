			<h4>ASCII Box Lab</h4>
			<p>Introducing the Eclipse IDE for Java. We used the System.out.println() statement to print 
			a line in the console. We also used the "\t" for a tab and the "\n" for printing a new line.
			</p>
			<h4>ASCII Box 2 Lab</h4>
			<p>In this small lab we use print statements once again. The println statements print piece of 
			dialog and then leave the cursor at the next line usually for more print statements. In this lab 
			we were supposed to copy and paste all the print statements, however, I decided to use the more 
			effecient "for" loop for the most repetetive code.
			</p>
			<h4>Input Basics Lab</h4>
			<p>In this lab we introduced the Scanner class in order for the user to be able to interact with 
			the program. To used the Scanner we first inported the Scanner. We defined the Scanner (gave it a name) 
			We prompted the user with a question about entering any integer. Since the integer is what the Scanner is 
			reading we code the Scanner as "intOne = keyboard.nextInt();". This stores the integer which the user inputs 
			as the variable "intOne".
			</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Input and output syntax: the "print" statement. This includes println and simple print statements.</li>
					<li>Importing the "Scanner" class so the program can read the user input.</li>
					<li>Using the Scanner to get different types of user input like integers and strings.</li>
					
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Java Story</h4>

			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>This project introduces the basic java suntax for user interacting and decision making
			statements. The program interacts with the user by prompting them with a problem and giving 
			them a limited number of decisions. The user types the decision into the console which the 
			program then translates into a string which is used to test the booleans in if, else if, and 
			else statements. The dicisions take the form of a tree where some branches lead to faliure of 
			the mission while some reach the goal but in different ways. This tree is constructed with 
			if statements in the program. In my program there is four branches and sometimes five branches 
			in the most complecated branches. We were also required to handle exceptions when the user 
			did not type a correct word when replying. To do this, I created by own exception called 
			"WrongInputException" (seen above in the screenshot). To implement this exception I used "try" 
			and "catch" staements and if staements to "throw" the exception.

					<li>Input and output syntax: the "print" statement.</li>
					<li>Importing the "Scanner" class so the program can read the user input.</li>
					<li>Using "if" statements and how to manage the boolean values</li>
					<li>Boolean values "equal to" and "or" and "and" statements to be used in the "if" 
					statements.</li>
