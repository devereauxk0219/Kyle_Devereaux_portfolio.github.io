			<h3>Diamond (Unit 1)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooDiamond.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>We used the Jeroo programm that runs on a java-based language 
			to make a "Jeroo" to create a diamond on the 
			island out of flowers. This activity required that the Jeroo 
			plants all the flowers, the Jeroo is not in the water and they 
			are facing south after the flowers have been planted. The map 
			is not a perfect even number so the diamond will be slightly 
			mis-shapen.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Basic Jeroo commands such as "hop();" in order to move.</li>
					<li>The "plant();" command to plant a flower.</li>
					<li>The "turn();" command that, when a direction is inputed 
					into the parenthesis, turn in the given direction.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Nets (Unit 1)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooNets.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to used some new commands and be 
			careful on timing in order to pickup flowers, hop and then toss 
			them into the net in order to get rid of the net. The requirements 
			included all nets and flowers gone and the Jeroo not hopping into 
			any of the nets. The number of hops the Jeroo takes must be tought 
			out to make sure that the nets will be taken out.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The "toss();" command. Used when a net is in front 
					of the Jeroo and the Jeroo gets rid of the net by tossing 
					a flower into it.</li>
					<li>The "pick();" command was used to pick up a flower 
					from where the Jeroo is standing.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>LED (Unit 2)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooLED.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to use different methods in order 
			to write 3 select numbers out of all digits (0-9). In order to 
			accomplish this with effecience we can use already existing digits 
			to complete the other digits. For example, the digit "5" can be 
			used to build the digit "0". These digits were required to be in 
			a 5 column and 7 row format, any digit can be called (max. of 3), 
			and each number must be 2 column spacing.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using different methods were introduced. Methods 
					organize the code and also make it more effecient in 
					looping situations.</li>
					<li>The situation where one mehtod can be used for 
					somethong more of its orginal purpose. This "recycling" 
					of codes is very efficient.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Flower Square (Unit 2)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooFlowerSquare.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>In this lab we were required to build a box that circles 
			the island completely. The Jeroo could not jup into the water 
			and methods could be used along with "while" loops. The Jeroo 
			should also stop were he started at (0, 0).<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The while loop: "while (<i>boolean statement</i>) { ... "</li>
					<li>The "isWater(<i>relative direction</i>)" to determine 
					when the water is ahead and to stop then.</li>
					<li>The "!" mark is used as a "not" statement in the 
					boolean conditional for the "while" loop.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Lockup (Unit 3)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooLockup.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>In this lab, the requirements were that all the flowers 
			and all the nets are completely gone in order to free the 
			three other traped Jeroos. Afetr this, all the Jeroos run 
			towards the water to the east and stop at the border. This 
			must be done with the given methods and loops.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Two while loops were used for the two borders of flowers.</li>
					<li>Multiple methods were used. The main method called these 
					other methods. This helped organized and make the code more 
					effecient.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Pinball (Unit 3)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooPinball.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>The Jeroo was required to start at (0, 0) and zig-zag down the 
			map in order to collect all the flowers. The Jeroo must stop at 
			the bottom of the map and not go into the water. A while loop with 
			the "isWater" boolean term should be used to simplify the code.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>"If" loops were used to sense if the Jeroo was facing 
					west or east in order to know which way to turn to the next 
					latitude.</li>
					<li>When turning to the next latitude, a pick(); command 
					was set int the method so flowers on the border would be 
					picked up.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Spiral (Unit 4)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooSpiral.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>The requirements of the spiral lab are that the Jeroo must 
			successfuly navigate to the end of the maze without going in the 
			water. After the Jeroo is at the end, Jeroo sould be facing the 
			the water. After this, the Jeroo turns around and goes back to 
			the beginnig of the maze. All this should be done with while 
			loops. The second island file is shown in the image.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The main method calls other methods which contain 
					while loops in order to hop while there is not water 
					in front of the Jeroo.</li>
					<li>After the while loops have ran, if statements 
					determine if the Jeroo turns right or left to co 
					the next segment of the maze.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Alley Run (Unit 4)</h3>
			<img src="Images/JerooAlleyRun.jpg" alt="screenshot">
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>In the Alley Run lab, the Jeroo must go throught the alley, 
			and using "if" statements, completes tasks with the flowers nets 
			and water. If there is a flower, the Jeroo must pick it up. if 
			there is a net the Jeroo must throw a flower into it to make 
			it disapear. And if there is water on one side of the alley, 
			the Jeroo must plant a flower on the other side of the alley. 
			Finally, at the end of the alley, the Jeroo stops.<p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Several "if" statements were used to sense the objects 
					around the Jeroo in the alley.</li>
					<li>The bolleans "isWater", "isFlower" and "isNet" were 
					used with the "if" and "while" staements.</li>
					<li>There is a principle while loop in the main method to 
					call the search method and the hop after each search is 
					done.</li>
				</ul>
